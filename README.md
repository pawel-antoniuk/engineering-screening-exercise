# Engineering Screening Exercise

Implement the following class. The solution will be evaluated based on your choice of data structures and the algorithmic efficiency, so think about how your solution will behave as the frequency of calls to accept and mean grows. 

Keep in mind that a functional solution may not be efficient. To pass this screening exercise, you need to implement a correct and efficient solution.

## Template for Java Developers

```
class Consumer
{
	/**
	 * Called periodically to consume an integer.
	 */

	public void accept( int number );

	/**
	 * Returns the mean (aka average) of numbers consumed in the 
       * last 5 minute period.
	 */

	public ? mean();
}
```
